      <p> Korea's traditional clothes are called "Hanbok" (한복). Hanbok means "Korea's clothes", <br>
          the "Han" meaning Korea and "Bok" meaning clothes. These traditional clothes were worn by Korean ancestors whom invented the clothes. <br>
          These Hanbok were made for casual wears back in the day, colorful hanboks worn by higher-classed people, and simple colored clothes were <br>
          worn by lower-classed people.
