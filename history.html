      <p>Before being called Korea, Korea was called "Joseon" by the ancestors. <br>
        Joseon was ruled by kings, like any other hierarchy. Joseon was also the Golden Age of Korea, <br>
        the invention of language, arts, mathematics were all developed during this time of age. More specifically, <br>
        once King Sejong, also known as Sejong the Great, took over the throne, he led Korea to their prime, creating <br>
        the culture and arts that people enjoy to this day. Joseon was created of 10 districts that the king managed on his own, <br>
        so he would usually leave it to his generals and ministers that he entrusted to take care of each districts.</p>

      <p>citizens were seperated by class. Higher-class people would serve the king, <br>
         or spend their times expanding their powers. Higher-classed people sometimes <br>
         took advantage of the citizens, stealing tax money and punishing citizens heavily <br>
         if they ever spoke up. Citizens refused to sit quiet, and had revolutions surrounding the districts. <br>
         However, there were higher-classed people who chose to help citizens, feeding them, paying them, helping them find jobs, <br>
         and looking out for them. Lower-class citizens would work for the king or higher-classes, farm, cook, or run restaurants.
